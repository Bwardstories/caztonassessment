# caztonassessment

I originally tried doing this assesment by taking an input value for each card 1-9, storing that in an array, mapping through that array and passing the value in through a prop to a Card component that was then rendered. I decided to change this because the animations I wanted to do wouldn't work correct with this method. I then started over and decided to create a database which would hold the values for each possible location. There are 9 cards and 9 locations for those card. Each location in this database would have 2 key value pairs, a top and left positioning. So a user would input each value from 1 to 9, only being able to use each value once and must use every value. I would then take that value they input, store it in an array, and loop through that array. As I looped through that aray, I would take the current value and the current index. the value is the card number that is being moved, and the index will take the value of the database at the same index, and that is the position the card will move to. That value is then set tot he card's state, which is passed into the card's animation property which takes a top and a left value. When that value is updated it will animate from the old location to the updated one.
